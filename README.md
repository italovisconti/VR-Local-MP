# Virtual Reality Local Multiplayer Template - Unity

Currently, there is no easy way to develop LAN Multiplayer Virtual Reality games with Unity. Unity offers the 'VR MP Template' which is tightly coupled to the Unity Relay service (for internet-based game).

As part of my undergraduate thesis, I modified several scripts from the 'VR MP Template' to be able to offer LAN multiplayer game scenes.

This repository contains the foundation of this thesis.
